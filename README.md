## Getting Started

This app is built with GraphQL and allows you to manage ingredients and recipes through mutations and queries. To get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Django
- GraphQL Server (Strawberry GraphQL)
- Docker

Clone the repository and set up the application by following the instructions in the "Running the App Locally" section below.

## GraphQL Mutations

### Create Ingredient

To create a new ingredient, use the `createIngredient` mutation with the required fields:

```graphql
mutation {
  createIngredient(input: { name: "Salt", description: "A basic seasoning ingredient" }) {
    id
    name
    description
  }
}
```

### Update Ingredient

To update an existing ingredient, use the `updateIngredient` mutation with the ingredientâ€™s `id` and the fields you want to modify:

```graphql
mutation {
  updateIngredient(id: 1, input: { name: "Sea Salt", description: "Salt from the sea" }) {
    id
    name
    description
  }
}
```

### Delete Ingredient

To delete an ingredient, use the `deleteIngredient` mutation by specifying the `id` of the ingredient you wish to delete:

```graphql
mutation {
  deleteIngredient(id: 1)
}
```

### Create Recipe

To create a recipe with a list of ingredient IDs, use the `createRecipe` mutation. Make sure the ingredient IDs you provide already exist in your database:

```graphql
mutation {
  createRecipe(input: {
    name: "Spaghetti Bolognese",
    description: "A classic Italian pasta dish",
    ingredients: [1, 2]  # List ingredient IDs here
  }) {
    id
    name
    description
    ingredients {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### Add Ingredient to Recipe

To add an ingredient to an existing recipe, use the `addIngredientToRecipe` mutation, specifying the `recipe_id` and `ingredient_id`:

```graphql
mutation {
  addIngredientToRecipe(recipeId: 1, ingredientId: 2) {
    id
    name
    ingredients {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### Remove Ingredient from Recipe

To remove an ingredient from a recipe, use the `removeIngredientFromRecipe` mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  removeIngredientFromRecipe(recipeId: 1, ingredientId: 2) {
    id
    name
    ingredients {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

## GraphQL Queries

You can also query the data to fetch ingredients and recipes.

### Query All Ingredients

To fetch a list of all ingredients:

```graphql
query {
  allIngredients {
    id
    name
    description
  }
}
```

### Query All Recipes

To fetch a list of all recipes:

```graphql
query {
  allRecipes {
    id
    name
    description
    ingredientCount  # This is a custom field created for ingredient count
    ingredients {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### Get Single Ingredient by ID

To fetch details of a specific ingredient by its ID:

```graphql
query {
  ingredient(id: 1) {
    id
    name
    description
  }
}
```

### Get Single Recipe by ID

To fetch details of a specific recipe by its ID:

```graphql
query {
  recipe(id: 1) {
    id
    name
    description
    ingredientCount
    ingredients {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

## Running the App Locally

To run the Recipe Management App locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recipe-mgmt-app.git
cd recipe-mgmt-app
```

### 2. Set up the environment

Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** and **Docker** installed.

### 3. Run the application with Docker Compose

Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine.

1. In the root of your project, run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

This will build and start the application along with any required services (e.g., database).

### 4. Start the Application and access the GraphQL Playground

Once the server is running, you can access the GraphQL playground at: [http://0.0.0.0/api/graphql/](http://0.0.0.0/api/graphql/)

From there, you can test the mutations and queries mentioned above.

That's it! You're ready to manage your ingredients and recipes using GraphQL. Happy coding!
